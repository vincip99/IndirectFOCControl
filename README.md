# IndirectFOCControl
This is a project with the goal of simulate an Indirect Field Oriented Control of an induction motor for the exams of Control of Electrical Drives.
The principal target of the assignment is to implement an indirect Field Oriented Control (Hasse) on an induction motor and simulate a given scenario. The motor is powered by a VSI inverter, which is connected to a DC source of 350V.

The motor parameter have been derived from the plate data, in particular the plate look like:

| Description | Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| $P~n$ | 150 kW |
| $V~n$ | 220 V |
| $f~n$ | 300Hz |
| $\sigma~n$ | 0.015 |
| $p$ | 6 |
| $J$ | 5 kgm^2 |
